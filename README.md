# warmup
A warmup exercise for Git

# Git Test

Perform this basic test:-

0. [ ] Fork this repository.
1. [ ] Remove the last commit from `feature01` branch.
1. [ ] Rebase the branch `feature01` on `master`.
2. [ ] Merge the branch `final_feature` into `master`.
3. [ ] Rebase the branch `feature01` on `master` again.
4. [ ] Make a PR to upstream (ie the repo your forked) to merge `feature01` of your fork into `feature01` of upstream.

We will check the PR to see if you did it right or not. Ideally, there should be no extra files in the PR.
